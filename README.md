# rouletteprogram
A simplified Roulette Game

The game starts by issuing a starting cedit and allowing the placing of bets
The game verifies the placed bet value is within the available balance of the player
Once a valid bet has been placed the game begins.
The program uses the RAND function to obtain an outcome
The outcome is then compared to the placed bet
If the outcome is within the parameters of the bet the reward is issued based on the odds and added to the players total
If the outcome is outside the parameters of the bet the player recieves an apology and a display of the players remaining balance
The game then gives the player the opportunity to play again or to exit the game
If the player chooses to exit the game they recieve an output of their remaining credit and the program exits.
